    dbt Feature Demonstration: TPC-H BENCHMARK QUERY Q3
    
    This model demonstrates:
    - ‚úÖ Official TPC-H Query 3 (Shipping Priority)
    - ‚úÖ Complex CTEs and multi-step logic
    - ‚úÖ Advanced Jinja templating with random sampling
    - ‚úÖ Revenue calculations and aggregations
    - ‚úÖ Performance benchmarking patterns
    - ‚ö†Ô∏è  INTENTIONAL direct source usage (TPC-H standard requires raw data)
    - ‚úÖ TOP N queries with LIMIT
    
    Complexity: ü•á RUN (Advanced)
    Layer: Bronze - Performance Benchmarking
    
    NOTE: This query intentionally uses source() directly to match official TPC-H 
    specifications for accurate performance benchmarking.

    The Shipping Priority Query retrieves the shipping priority and potential revenue, defined as the sum of
    l_extendedprice * (1-l_discount), of the orders having the largest revenue among those that had not been shipped as
    of a given date. Orders are listed in decreasing order of revenue. If more than 10 unshipped orders exist, only the 10
    orders with the largest revenue are listed.
