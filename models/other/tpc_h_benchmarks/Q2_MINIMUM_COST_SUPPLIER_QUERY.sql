    dbt Feature Demonstration: TPC-H BENCHMARK QUERY Q2

    This model demonstrates:
    - ✅ Official TPC-H Query 2 (Minimum Cost Supplier)
    - ✅ Complex multi-table joins and subqueries
    - ✅ Advanced Jinja templating with random sampling
    - ✅ Window functions and ranking
    - ✅ Performance benchmarking patterns
    - ⚠️  INTENTIONAL direct source usage (TPC-H standard requires raw data)
    - ✅ Complex WHERE clause conditions

    Complexity: 🥇 RUN (Advanced)
    Layer: Bronze - Performance Benchmarking

    NOTE: This query intentionally uses source() directly to match official TPC-H
    specifications for accurate performance benchmarking.

    The Minimum Cost Supplier Query finds, in a given region, for each part of a certain type and size, the supplier who
    can supply it at minimum cost. If several suppliers in that region offer the desired part type and size at the same
    (minimum) cost, the query lists the parts from suppliers with the 100 highest account balances. For each supplier,
    the query lists the supplier's account balance, name and nation; the part's number and manufacturer; the supplier's
    address, phone number and comment information.
