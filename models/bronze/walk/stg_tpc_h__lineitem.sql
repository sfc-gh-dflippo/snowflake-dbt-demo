/*
    dbt Feature Demonstration: COMPLEX STAGING MODEL
    
    This model demonstrates:
    - ✅ Staging layer best practices (1:1 with source)
    - ✅ Ephemeral materialization (inherited from dbt_project.yml)
    - ✅ Complex schema with composite primary keys
    - ✅ Multiple foreign key relationships
    - ✅ Extensive column renaming and standardization
    - ✅ Source function usage
    - ✅ CTE pattern for readability
    
    Complexity: 🥈 WALK (Intermediate)
    Layer: Bronze - Complex Staging
