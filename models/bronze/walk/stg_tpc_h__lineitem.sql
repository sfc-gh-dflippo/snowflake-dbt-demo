    dbt Feature Demonstration: COMPLEX STAGING MODEL
    
    This model demonstrates:
    - âœ… Staging layer best practices (1:1 with source)
    - âœ… Ephemeral materialization (inherited from dbt_project.yml)
    - âœ… Complex schema with composite primary keys
    - âœ… Multiple foreign key relationships
    - âœ… Extensive column renaming and standardization
    - âœ… Source function usage
    - âœ… CTE pattern for readability
    
    Complexity: ðŸ¥ˆ WALK (Intermediate)
    Layer: Bronze - Complex Staging
