    - âœ… Real-time data refresh with target_lag
    - âœ… Warehouse configuration for compute
    - âœ… Advanced Jinja templating with variables
    - âœ… Complex aggregations and window functions
    - âœ… Configuration change handling
    - âœ… Time-based partitioning and analytics
    - âœ… Business metrics calculation
