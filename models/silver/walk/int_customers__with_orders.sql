/*
    dbt Feature Demonstration: INTERMEDIATE MODEL - BUSINESS LOGIC

    This model demonstrates:
    - ✅ Intermediate layer best practices (business logic isolation)
    - ✅ Ephemeral materialization for reusable components
    - ✅ Aggregation functions (COUNT, SUM, MIN, MAX)
    - ✅ Window functions for analytics
    - ✅ Model aliasing for backward compatibility
    - ✅ References to staging models only (no direct sources)
    - ✅ CTE pattern for complex transformations

    Complexity: 🥈 WALK (Intermediate)
    Layer: Silver - Business Logic
