    dbt Feature Demonstration: INTERMEDIATE MODEL - BUSINESS LOGIC
    
    This model demonstrates:
    - âœ… Intermediate layer best practices (business logic isolation)
    - âœ… Ephemeral materialization for reusable components
    - âœ… Aggregation functions (COUNT, SUM, MIN, MAX)
    - âœ… Window functions for analytics
    - âœ… Model aliasing for backward compatibility
    - âœ… References to staging models only (no direct sources)
    - âœ… CTE pattern for complex transformations
    
    Complexity: ðŸ¥ˆ WALK (Intermediate)
    Layer: Silver - Business Logic
