## Agent Guidelines and Constraints

### Code Standards
- **Consistency** - Follow established patterns across the project
- **Testability** - Models should have appropriate data quality tests
- **Documentation** - Document business logic, complex transformations, models, and columns

### Skills

**What are Skills?**

Skills are structured instruction sets that enhance AI assistant capabilities for specific domains or tasks. Each skill is a folder containing:
- **SKILL.md** - Core instructions and guidelines
- **references/** - Detailed documentation and examples
- **scripts/** - Helper scripts and templates
- **config/** - Configuration files

Skills provide domain-specific knowledge, best practices, code templates, and troubleshooting strategies. Think of them as specialized "expert personas" for areas like dbt development, Snowflake operations, or testing frameworks.

**Key Features:**
- Skills can be enabled `[x]` or disabled `[ ]` individually
- Organized by project-specific and reference examples

### Safety and permissions

#### Allowed without prompt:
- read files, list files
- reformat SQL
- executing dbt models
- query Snowflake database

#### Ask first: 
- Adding dbt macros, dbt packages, or python libraries
- git push
- deleting files, chmod

### Security Requirements
- **Never hardcode credentials** - Always use configuration files or environment variables

### Performance Guidelines  
- **Use incremental materialization** for data pipelines with many rows
- **Apply appropriate clustering keys** for frequently queried columns
- **Size warehouses** based on execution time and model complexity

### Testing Requirements
- **Use `dbt build` instead of `dbt run`** to run dbt tests after model execution (`dbt build --select modelname`)
- **Use dbt_constraints** for primary/unique/foreign key validation

### Deployment Process
- **Test connection** with `dbt debug` before deployment
- **Deploy to dev, test, prod using Python script** with `python deploy_dbt_project.py --target environment_name`
- **Validate in production** with `dbt build --target prod`

## Specification-Driven Development Process

This project follows **Specification-Driven Development (SDD)** methodology, where a detailed, often executable, specification serves as the blueprint for development, testing, and documentation. This approach ensures stakeholder alignment, improves code quality, and enables efficient development cycles.

### Core SDD Principles
- **Early Specification Definition** - Clear requirements, objectives, and constraints upfront
- **Stakeholder Collaboration** - Engage all parties to align with business goals
- **Iterative Refinement** - Continuously update specifications based on feedback
- **Traceability** - Maintain clear links between specifications and implementation
- **Test-First Approach** - Define validation criteria before implementation

### Development Workflow

#### **Phase 1: Define the Functional and Technical Specifications**
1. **Gather Requirements** - Start with user stories or high-level requirements
   - Create comprehensive requirements, plans, and tasks in a `CLAUDE.md` file in the project root folder
   - Define functional requirements and design goals
   - Document business logic and transformation requirements
   - Specify acceptance criteria and validation requirements

2. **Write Clear Specs** - Document specifications in structured format
   - Use natural language that is easy for technology architects and engineers to review
   - Define data models, APIs, interfaces, and system behavior
   - Outline performance and scalability requirements
   - Establish quality and testing standards

3. **Validate Specifications** - Collaborate with stakeholders for approval
   - Validate business alignment and technical feasibility
   - Ensure completeness and clarity of specifications
   - Approve scope and acceptance criteria
   - Confirm specifications align with business needs

#### **Phase 2: Design and Plan**
4. **Research** - Research on the web to understand implementation approaches
   - Research current best practices and patterns
   - Validate technical approaches against requirements
   - Gather implementation context and examples
   - Identify architectural patterns and technology choices

5. **Architectural Design** - Develop the technical solutions
   - Design system architecture and process logic
   - Define technology stack and integration patterns
   - Plan data flow and system interactions
   - Document technical design decisions

6. **Parse and Break Down** - Generate tasks from specifications
   - Automatically convert specifications into actionable tasks
   - Analyze the complexity of each task to identify complex tasks
   - Break down high/medium complexity tasks into subtasks
   - Maintain traceability between requirements and implementation tasks

7. **Organize Tasks** - Set dependencies and priorities
   - Add dependencies to your tasks to establish logical task sequencing
   - Identify critical path and bottlenecks
   - Align priorities with business value and technical dependencies

#### **Phase 3: Implement and Test**
8. **Code Development** - Use list of tasks for development
   - Follow test-first development approach
   - Implement functionality defined in the specification
   - Write code to meet predefined specifications
   - Ensure code aligns with architectural design

9. **Test Generation and Execution** - Derive tests from acceptance criteria
   - Generate automated tests directly from specification criteria
   - Execute specification-based tests
   - Validate functionality against requirements
   - Ensure performance meets specified requirements

10. **Document Progress** - Log implementation decisions and findings
    - Update the `CLAUDE.md` continueously
    - Update specifications based on learnings
    - Maintain audit trail of changes and decisions
    - Update task completion

#### **Phase 4: Iterate and Refine**
11. **Validation** - Test implementation against specification
    - Verify all acceptance criteria are met
    - Confirm specification compliance
    - Validate system behavior matches requirements

12. **Refine** - Iterate on specification, design, or implementation
    - Refine specifications if new insights arise
    - Update implementation until tests pass
    - Ensure requirements are fully met
    - Update task completion

13. **Maintain Traceability** - Keep specification as living document
    - Maintain continuous alignment throughout project lifecycle
    - Update documentation to reflect final implementation
    - Prepare for deployment and future maintenance
