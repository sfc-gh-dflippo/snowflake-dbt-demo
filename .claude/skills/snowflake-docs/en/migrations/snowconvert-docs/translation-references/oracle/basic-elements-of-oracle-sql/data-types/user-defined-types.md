# SnowConvert AI - Oracle - User-Defined Types[¶](#snowconvert-ai-oracle-user-defined-types "Link to this heading")

## Description[¶](#description "Link to this heading")

> User-defined data types use Oracle built-in data types and other user-defined data types as the building blocks of object types that model the structure and behavior of data in applications. The sections that follow describe the various categories of user-defined types. ([Oracle SQL Language Reference User-defined Data Types](https://docs.oracle.com/en/database/oracle/oracle-database/21/sqlrf/Data-Types.html#GUID-7CF27C66-9908-4C02-9401-06C2F2C4021C))

Warning

Snowflake does not have any support for User-defined Types. This page is meant to be a summary of Oracle’s features. For the current status of User-defined Types in the SnowConvert AI tool please refer to the [Create Type Statement Page](../../sql-translation-reference/create_type) and its subpages.

## Object Types[¶](#object-types "Link to this heading")

Note

SnowConvert AI offers partial translation for Object Types, for more information on this, please refer to the next section: [Object type definition](../../sql-translation-reference/create_type.html#object-type-definition)

## REF Data Types[¶](#ref-data-types "Link to this heading")

Danger

Ref Data Types are not recognized by SnowConvert AI, and are instead shown as unrecognized “User-defined Functions”. For more information about them, please read the [REF Data Types subpage](#ref-data-types).

> An object identifier (represented by the keyword `OID`) uniquely identifies an object and enables you to reference the object from other objects or from relational tables. A data type category called `REF` represents such references. A `REF` data type is a container for an object identifier. `REF` values are pointers to objects. ([Oracle SQL Language Reference REF Data Types](https://docs.oracle.com/en/database/oracle/oracle-database/21/sqlrf/Data-Types.html#GUID-C9818949-BB51-4EB1-9A6D-2BE1F53B105D))

## Varrays[¶](#varrays "Link to this heading")

Warning

SnowConvert AI only recognizes these elements but does not offer any translation for them, for more information on this, please refer to the next section: [Array type definition](../../sql-translation-reference/create_type.html#array-type-definition)

## Nested Tables[¶](#nested-tables "Link to this heading")

Warning

SnowConvert AI only recognizes these elements but does not offer any translation for them since there are no known workarounds for them, for more information on this, please refer to the next section:[Nested table type definition](../../sql-translation-reference/create_type.html#nested-table-type-definition)

## Known Issues[¶](#known-issues "Link to this heading")

### 1. DML usages for Object Types are not being transformed[¶](#dml-usages-for-object-types-are-not-being-transformed "Link to this heading")

As of now, only DDL definitions that use User-Defined Types are being transformed into Variant. This means that any Inserts, Updates or Deletes using User-defined Types are not being transformed and need to be manually transformed. There is no EWI for this but there is a work item to add this corresponding EWI.

#### 2. Nested Table types are not being transformed[¶](#nested-table-types-are-not-being-transformed "Link to this heading")

There is no known workaround for implementing Nested Tables, for this reason SnowConvert AI only offers recognition of these elements.

#### 3. Array types are not being transformed[¶](#array-types-are-not-being-transformed "Link to this heading")

For now SnowConvert AI only recognizes these elements. A known workaround exists and there is a work item to implement them.

#### 4. REF Data Types are not supported by SnowConvert AI, but there is no EWI related to them[¶](#ref-data-types-are-not-supported-by-snowconvert-ai-but-there-is-no-ewi-related-to-them "Link to this heading")

They are not supported, and instead are reported as an unknown User-Defined Function, but there is a work item to add this corresponding EWI.

## Related EWIs[¶](#related-ewis "Link to this heading")

No related EWIs.

## REF Data Types[¶](#id1 "Link to this heading")

Note

Some parts in the output code are omitted for clarity reasons.

### Description[¶](#id2 "Link to this heading")

> An object identifier (represented by the keyword `OID`) uniquely identifies an object and enables you to reference the object from other objects or relational tables. A data type category called `REF` represents such references. A `REF` data type is a container for an object identifier. `REF` values are pointers to objects. ([Oracle SQL Language Reference REF Data Types](https://docs.oracle.com/en/database/oracle/oracle-database/21/sqlrf/Data-Types.html#GUID-C9818949-BB51-4EB1-9A6D-2BE1F53B105D))

REF Data types are not supported in Snowflake, and there is no current workaround to implement a similar component.

As of now, they are currently being recognized as user-defined functions and “DANGLING” clauses are not being recognized. Finally, the OID clause in view is being removed, as there is no workaround for them.

```
CREATE VIEW generic_view AS
SELECT REF(type) AS ref_col, MAKE_REF(type, identifier_column) AS make_ref_col
FROM generic_table;

SELECT v.ref_col, v.make_ref_col
FROM generic_view v
WHERE v.ref_col IS NOT DANGLING AND v.make_ref_col IS NOT DANGLING
```

### Sample Source Patterns[¶](#sample-source-patterns "Link to this heading")

#### Types and Tables for References[¶](#types-and-tables-for-references "Link to this heading")

Please consider the following types, tables, inserts and view. They will be used for the next pattern section.

##### Oracle[¶](#oracle "Link to this heading")

```
CREATE TYPE email_typ_demo AS OBJECT
	( email_id INTEGER
	, email VARCHAR2(30)
	);

CREATE TYPE customer_typ_demo AS OBJECT
    ( customer_id        INTEGER
    , cust_first_name    VARCHAR2(20)
    , cust_last_name     VARCHAR2(20)
    , email_id			 INTEGER
    ) ;

CREATE TABLE email_table_demo OF email_typ_demo;
CREATE TABLE customer_table_demo OF customer_typ_demo;

INSERT INTO customer_table_demo VALUES
(customer_typ_demo(1, 'First Name 1', 'Last Name 1', 1));

INSERT INTO customer_table_demo VALUES
(customer_typ_demo(2, 'First Name 2', 'Last Name 2', 2));

INSERT INTO email_table_demo VALUES 
(email_typ_demo(1, 'abc@def.com'));

CREATE VIEW email_object_view OF email_typ_demo WITH OBJECT IDENTIFIER (email_id) AS
SELECT * FROM email_table_demo;
```

#### Selects and Views using REFs[¶](#selects-and-views-using-refs "Link to this heading")

##### Oracle[¶](#id3 "Link to this heading")

     , MAKE_REF(email_object_view, ctb.email_id) AS email_ref

FROM customer_view c;

SELECT c.customer_reference.cust_first_name, c.email_ref.email

### Known Issues[¶](#id4 "Link to this heading")

**1. REF and MAKE\_REF are not being recognized**

Instead they are currently being marked as user-defined functions.

**2. DANGLING clause is not being recognized**

DANGLING clauses are causing parsing errors when running SnowConvert.

#### 3. OID Clauses in view are not supported by SnowConvert AI, but there is no EWI related to them[¶](#oid-clauses-in-view-are-not-supported-by-snowconvert-ai-but-there-is-no-ewi-related-to-them "Link to this heading")

The OID clause is not supported by either SnowConvert AI, nor Snowflake but there should be an EWI related to them.

### Related EWIs[¶](#id5 "Link to this heading")

1. [SSC-EWI-0001](../../../../general/technical-documentation/issues-and-troubleshooting/conversion-issues/generalEWI.html#ssc-ewi-0001): Unrecognized token on the line of the source code.
2. [SSC-EWI-0073](../../../../general/technical-documentation/issues-and-troubleshooting/conversion-issues/generalEWI.html#ssc-ewi-0073): Pending Functional Equivalence Review.
3. [SSC-FDM-0001](../../../../general/technical-documentation/issues-and-troubleshooting/functional-difference/generalFDM.html#ssc-fdm-0001): Views selecting all columns from a single table are not required in Snowflake.
