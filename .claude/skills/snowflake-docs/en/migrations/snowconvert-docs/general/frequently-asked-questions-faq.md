## With the release of version 1.2.0 what changes for current SnowConvert AI users?[¶](#with-the-release-of-version-1-2-0-what-changes-for-current-snowconvert-ai-users "Link to this heading")

To unlock SnowConvert AI features, users need to obtain an access code from Snowflake. This code enables either assessment or conversion functionalities. The following changes are being implemented in this release:

* SnowConvert AI will automatically generate an access code when requested by the user.
* The process has been simplified: SnowConvert AI will now produce both the assessment report and converted code in a single step, eliminating the need for separate Assessment and Conversion modes.
* A single access code will now grant access to all supported platforms, rather than being limited to one source platform. All other aspects of the user experience remain the same.

To ensure you get the best conversion results, we recommend regularly updating to the latest version of SnowConvert AI. Each new version includes improved conversion rules and enhanced code quality.

Before installing a new version of SnowConvert AI, please uninstall any existing version from your system. After uninstalling, download and install the latest version.

## How do I get SnowConvert AI?[¶](#how-do-i-get-snowconvert-ai "Link to this heading")

SnowConvert AI can be officially downloaded in the Snowsight Snowflake web page.

However, it is highly recommended to take the free course “[SnowConvert AI for Conversion](https://training.snowflake.com/lmt/!clmsLink.dt?site=sf&amp;region=us&amp;lang=en-us&amp;type=O&amp;id=130596852)”. This course is both an overview and a technical hands on training of how to use SnowConvert AI for assessments and conversions. Once you complete the course you will receive an email with the download instructions, and can generate an access code via the tool interface.

## How do I get an access code for SnowConvert AI?[¶](#how-do-i-get-an-access-code-for-snowconvert-ai "Link to this heading")

You can obtain an access code by following the instructions in [How to Get an Access Code](user-guide/snowconvert/how-to-request-an-access-code/README).

If you require additional help, please contact our customer support team at [snowconvert-support@snowflake.com](mailto:snowconvert-support%40snowflake.com)

## How do I give permission to SnowConvert AI config folder?[¶](#how-do-i-give-permission-to-snowconvert-ai-config-folder "Link to this heading")

Providing access to the SnowConvert AI configuration folder depends on your operating system.

![image](../../../_images/image%28456%29.png)

SnowConvert AI requires read, write, and execute permissions for its configuration folder (`.config` on MacOS or `AppData` on Windows). This folder stores temporary files, logs, and license information. To grant SnowConvert AI access to this folder, follow these steps:

### For MacOs[¶](#id1 "Link to this heading")

1. Open a Terminal window.
2. Navigate to your home directory by typing `cd ~` and pressing Enter.
3. Change the permissions of the .config directory by typing `chmod 777 .config`. If you receive a “Operation not permitted” error, run the command with sudo: `sudo chmod 777 .config`.
4. Close the Terminal window and launch SnowConvert AI.

### For Windows[¶](#id2 "Link to this heading")

1. Open the **Run** dialog by pressing the **Windows key + R** on your keyboard.
2. Enter `%AppData%` and press **Enter** or click **OK**.
3. Find the Snowflake Inc folder, right-click on it, and verify that the `Read-only` checkbox under Attributes is unchecked.

## How do I make sure that .config is a folder instead of a file?[¶](#how-do-i-make-sure-that-config-is-a-folder-instead-of-a-file "Link to this heading")

*This problem only affects macOS systems.*

![The modal shown when .config is a file instead of a folder](../../../_images/image%281%29.png)

SnowConvert AI requires read, write, and execute permissions for the configuration folder (`.config` on macOS). This folder is used to store temporary files, log files, and license information.

The `.config` must be a directory (folder). If you find that `.config` exists as a file, you need to convert it to a directory and set the appropriate permissions.

To resolve this issue, follow these steps:

1. Find the `.config` file in your home directory at `'/Users/[Username]/'`.
2. Delete the `.config` file.
3. Create a new folder called `.config` in the same location.
4. Launch Terminal.
5. Navigate to your home directory by typing `cd ~` and pressing Enter.
6. Change folder permissions by typing `chmod 777 .config`. If you see an `Operation not permitted` error, use `sudo chmod 777 .config` instead.
7. Exit Terminal and start SnowConvert AI.

## What is a Top-Level Code Unit?[¶](#what-is-a-top-level-code-unit "Link to this heading")

A Code Unit is the smallest independent piece of code that can be executed. While Code Units typically consist of individual statements, they can also be entire script files since these are executed as one unit. Code Units can be hierarchical, with some units contained within others. When a Code Unit is not nested within any other unit, it is referred to as a Top-Level Code Unit.

## Does SnowConvert AI provide resources to understand how it translates SQL code?[¶](#does-snowconvert-ai-provide-resources-to-understand-how-it-translates-sql-code "Link to this heading")

You can find the translation reference for each source in the following locations:

* [Teradata](../translation-references/teradata/README)
* [Oracle](../translation-references/oracle/README)
* [SQL Server](../translation-references/transact/README)

---

## What is the code completeness metric?[¶](#what-is-the-code-completeness-metric "Link to this heading")

The Code Completeness score shows whether all necessary code components are present in your codebase. A score below 100 indicates that SnowConvert AI has detected missing object references that may be required for successful migration.

### Why my files are not being converted and marked with the code SSC-OOS-001?[¶](#why-my-files-are-not-being-converted-and-marked-with-the-code-ssc-oos-001 "Link to this heading")

Depending on the selected encoding, SnowConvert AI will not be able to parse the input; you should validate the correct encoding in the settings options before starting a conversion. [How to use the setting](getting-started/running-snowconvert/conversion/general-conversion-settings.html#file-encoding-settings).

---

## Are there release notes available for previous versions of SnowConvert AI?[¶](#are-there-release-notes-available-for-previous-versions-of-snowconvert-ai "Link to this heading")

Release notes are available here: [release-notes](release-notes/release-notes/README)

---

## Is SnowConvert AI a free tool, or are there paid plans available?[¶](#is-snowconvert-ai-a-free-tool-or-are-there-paid-plans-available "Link to this heading")

SnowConvert AI is now free for everyone and allows full conversion functionality of your workload.

Besides, if you need additional support you are provided with the option of a Professional Service Engagement.

---

## Why SnowConvert AI is not auto-updating?[¶](#why-snowconvert-ai-is-not-auto-updating "Link to this heading")

![image](../../../_images/image%28535%29.png)

### Internet connection[¶](#internet-connection "Link to this heading")

SnowConvert AI automatically checks for new versions when you have an active internet connection. If you receive an error message, first verify that your system is connected to the internet and that the connection is working properly.

If you are still experiencing connection problems, it may be due to a Firewall rule blocking your access.

#### Firewall Blocked[¶](#firewall-blocked "Link to this heading")

SnowConvert AI checks for updates by connecting to a Snowflake storage service. If your local firewall blocks access to this site, you won’t be able to get updates. If you see a “Destination unreachable” message, ask your network administrator to whitelist the `https://snowconvert.snowflake.com/` website.

---

## How can I remove my licenses ?[¶](#how-can-i-remove-my-licenses "Link to this heading")

To remove all SnowConvert AI licenses, you need to delete the `.profile` file in the config folder. The file location depends on your operating system. Follow the steps specific to your operating system to locate and delete this file.

### Windows[¶](#windows "Link to this heading")

* Exit SnowConvert AI completely.
* Press the Windows key (`⊞ Win`) and ‘R’ key together to open the Run command window. Type `%appdata%Snowflake Inc` and press Enter.
* Find and delete the file named `.profile`.

### MacOS[¶](#macos "Link to this heading")

* Exit SnowConvert AI if it is currently running
* Open Finder and use the keyboard shortcut `⌘ + Shift ⇧ + G` to open “Go to Folder”. Enter `~/.config/Snowflake Inc/` to access the configuration directory
* Look for the “.profile” file. On Mac systems, this is a hidden file. To view hidden files, use the keyboard shortcut `⌘ + Shift ⇧ + .`
* Find and remove the “.profile” file

After deleting the file, when you open SnowConvert AI, you will see an empty license list.

## Why I am not receiving an access code ?[¶](#why-i-am-not-receiving-an-access-code "Link to this heading")

SnowConvert AI communicates with an API to generate access codes. If this communication fails, you will receive an error message similar to this:

![image](../../../_images/image%28467%29.png)

If you are using a version older than 1.13.0, we encourage you to update SnowConvert AI to the latest version. If updating is not possible, ensure your network allows both incoming and outgoing connections to the licensing API at <https://snowconvert.snowflake.com/licensing/health>. Please work with your network administrator to configure these permissions.

If the error persists after updating, ensure your network allows both incoming and outgoing connections to the licensing API at <https://snowconvert.snowflake.com/licensing>. Please work with your network administrator to configure these permissions.
