# Managing accounts in your organization[¶](#managing-accounts-in-your-organization "Link to this heading")

An organization administrator manages the lifecycle of every account that belongs to the organization, from creating a new account to
deleting it.

| --- | --- |
| [Create an account](organizations-manage-accounts-create) | Add an account to the organization. |
| [View a list of accounts](organizations-manage-accounts-view) | Obtain a list of the accounts that currently belong to the organization. |
| [Rename an account](organizations-manage-accounts-rename) | Change the name of an account and specify whether users can access the account using the original URL. |
| [Manage account URLs](organizations-manage-accounts-urls) | Understand what happens to an [account URL](organizations-connect.html#label-connecting-via-url) when an account is renamed or has its organization modified, and delete old account URLs when necessary. |
| [Work with the account edition](organizations-manage-accounts-editions) | View the current Snowflake edition of an account. |
| [Drop an account](organizations-manage-accounts-delete) | Removes an account from the organization. |
