# Snowflake Ecosystem[¶](#snowflake-ecosystem "Link to this heading")

Snowflake works with a wide array of industry-leading tools and technologies, enabling you to access Snowflake through an extensive network
of connectors, drivers, programming languages, and utilities, including:

* Certified partners who have developed cloud-based and on-premises solutions for connecting to Snowflake.
* Other 3rd-party tools and technologies that are known to work with Snowflake.
* Snowflake-provided clients, including the [Snowflake CLI](../developer-guide/snowflake-cli/index) and [SnowSQL](snowsql) command line tools, connectors for
  [Python](../developer-guide/python-connector/python-connector) and [Spark](spark-connector), and drivers for
  [Node.js](../developer-guide/node-js/nodejs-driver), [JDBC](../developer-guide/jdbc/jdbc), [ODBC](../developer-guide/odbc/odbc), and more.
