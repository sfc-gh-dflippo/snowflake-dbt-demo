# dbt Artifacts Package - AI Instructions

## Purpose

This skill enables AI agents to help users monitor dbt execution using the
brooklyn-data/dbt_artifacts package. The package captures detailed execution metadata during dbt
runs and stores it in queryable tables for analysis and monitoring.

## When to Use This Skill

Activate this skill when users ask about:

- Tracking test and model execution history
- Analyzing dbt run patterns over time
- Monitoring data quality metrics from dbt tests
- Investigating dbt performance issues or slow models
- Setting up execution logging and observability
- Querying dbt execution metadata programmatically
- Comparing dbt monitoring approaches (Artifacts vs Event Tables)

## What dbt Artifacts Does

The package captures one row per dbt artifact execution (models, tests, seeds, snapshots) with:

- **Execution status**: success, error, skipped, fail, warn
- **Runtime metrics**: Duration, rows affected, compile time
- **Test results**: Failure counts, error messages
- **Run context**: Command, environment, dbt version, threading
- **Dependencies**: Model lineage and relationships

## Core Tables Reference

| Table              | Purpose                   | Key Columns                                                             |
| ------------------ | ------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `invocations`      | One row per dbt run       | `command_invocation_id`, `dbt_command`, `target_name`, `run_started_at` |
| `model_executions` | Model runtime performance | `status`, `total_node_runtime`, `rows_affected`, `materialization`      |
| `test_executions`  | Data quality tracking     | `status`, `failures`, `total_node_runtime`, `message`                   |
| `seeds`            | Seed file execution       | Similar to model_executions                                             |
| `snapshots`        | Snapshot execution        | Similar to model_executions with SCD tracking                           |
| `sources`          | Source freshness          | Freshness check results                                                 |
| `exposures`        | Exposure execution        | Exposure dependencies                                                   |

**Join Pattern**: Always join through `command_invocation_id` (links all executions in a run) and
`node_id` (identifies specific artifact).

## Installation & Setup

When users need to install or configure dbt Artifacts:

### Step 1: Add Package

Add to `packages.yml`:

```yaml
packages:
  - package: brooklyn-data/dbt_artifacts
    version: 2.9.3
```

### Step 2: Configure Hook

Add to `dbt_project.yml`:

```yaml
on-run-end:
  - "{{ dbt_artifacts.upload_results(results) }}"

models:
  dbt_artifacts:
    +database: your_database
    +schema: dbt_artifacts
```

### Step 3: Install and Initialize

```bash
dbt deps
dbt run --select dbt_artifacts
```

After first run, all subsequent dbt invocations automatically log results.

## Helping Users with Queries

### Query Strategy

When users ask for monitoring queries:

1. **Identify the goal**: What are they trying to monitor? (test failures, slow models, run history,
   etc.)
2. **Reference query library**: Point to relevant queries in the `scripts/` directory (see
   **Monitoring Queries** section below)
3. **Customize as needed**: Adjust date ranges, filters, thresholds
4. **Explain results**: Help interpret the output and recommend actions

### Common Query Patterns

All queries are available as individual executable scripts. See the **Monitoring Queries** section
below for detailed descriptions and usage.

### Query Best Practices

**ALWAYS recommend these patterns:**

- ✅ Filter by `run_started_at` with specific date range (performance)

  ```sql
  WHERE run_started_at >= DATEADD(day, -7, CURRENT_TIMESTAMP())
  ```

- ✅ Use `command_invocation_id` to link related executions efficiently
- ✅ Filter `HAVING COUNT(*) >= 5` for meaningful aggregations
- ✅ Join through both `command_invocation_id` AND `node_id` when linking metadata to executions

**NEVER do these:**

- ❌ Query entire table without date filtering

  ```sql
  -- BAD: Scans entire history
  SELECT * FROM test_executions WHERE status = 'fail';

  -- GOOD: Filtered by date
  SELECT * FROM test_executions
  WHERE status = 'fail'
    AND run_started_at >= DATEADD(day, -7, CURRENT_TIMESTAMP());
  ```

- ❌ Create alerts for every single test failure (too noisy)
- ❌ Store more than 6 months without archival strategy

### Storage Management

**Archival Strategy (Quarterly):**

```sql
-- Archive data older than 90 days
CREATE TABLE dbt_artifacts_archive.model_executions_2024_q4 AS
SELECT *
FROM dbt_artifacts.model_executions
WHERE run_started_at < DATEADD(day, -90, CURRENT_DATE());

-- Delete archived data from active tables
DELETE FROM dbt_artifacts.model_executions
WHERE run_started_at < DATEADD(day, -90, CURRENT_DATE());
```

**Storage Planning:**

- Small project (50 models, 100 tests): ~1-5 MB/week
- Medium project (200 models, 500 tests): ~10-20 MB/week
- Large project (1000+ models, 2000+ tests): ~50-100 MB/week

Plan for **1-2 GB per quarter** for medium projects.

## Comparing Monitoring Approaches

When users ask "Should I use dbt Artifacts or Event Tables?":

### Use dbt Artifacts When

**Cross-platform compatibility is critical:**

- Running dbt from multiple platforms (dbt Cloud, local CLI, Airflow, etc.)
- Need consistent monitoring across all execution environments
- Team uses mixed deployment strategies

**Historical analysis is primary goal:**

- Analyzing trends over 30+ days
- Long-term performance baseline tracking
- Quarterly or annual reporting on dbt execution
- Compliance or audit trail requirements

**Running dbt outside Snowflake:**

- Using dbt Cloud exclusively
- Executing dbt from Airflow, Azure DevOps, GitHub Actions
- Local development with dbt CLI
- Any non-Snowflake execution environment

**Programmatic access to metadata required:**

- Building custom dashboards in BI tools
- Integrating with existing observability platforms
- Creating custom alerting logic
- Feeding data to data catalogs or lineage tools

**Delayed reporting is acceptable:**

- Runs on `on-run-end` hook (after full execution completes)
- Historical batch analysis vs real-time monitoring
- End-of-run summaries are sufficient

### Avoid dbt Artifacts When

**Real-time monitoring is critical:**

- Need immediate notification of failures
- Want to see execution progress during runs
- Require detailed trace spans and profiling → **Use**: dbt Projects on Snowflake Event Tables

**Running exclusively in Snowflake:**

- Using dbt PROJECT objects in Snowflake
- Native Snowflake integration preferred
- Want Snowflake-native telemetry → **Use**: dbt Projects Event Tables

**Storage constraints exist:**

- Limited database space for historical data
- Can't maintain growing execution history
- No archival strategy in place → **Use**: Event Tables with shorter retention or external logging

### Use Both for Comprehensive Monitoring

**Recommended Architecture:**

```sql
dbt Artifacts (Historical)          Event Tables (Real-time)
        ↓                                    ↓
Long-term trends                   Immediate alerts
Quarterly reports                  Live dashboards
Cross-platform metrics             Trace-level profiling
BI tool integration               Native Snowflake tools
```

**Example:**

1. **Event Tables**: Monitor active runs in real-time, alert on failures immediately
2. **dbt Artifacts**: Analyze historical patterns, track monthly trends, feed BI dashboards

### Comparison Matrix

| Feature                   | dbt Artifacts             | dbt Projects Event Tables     |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| **Execution Environment** | Any (Cloud, CLI, Airflow) | Snowflake native only         |
| **Telemetry Timing**      | On run completion (hook)  | Real-time during execution    |
| **Historical Data**       | User-managed retention    | Configurable retention policy |
| **Platform Integration**  | Cross-platform            | Snowflake-native              |
| **Query Interface**       | Standard SQL tables       | Event table syntax            |
| **Setup Complexity**      | Package + hook config     | dbt PROJECT configuration     |
| **Trace Spans**           | No                        | Yes (detailed profiling)      |
| **Best For**              | Historical analysis       | Real-time monitoring          |

2. Adjust date range if needed (default: last 7 days)
3. Explain how to interpret `failures` column (0 = pass, >0 = fail)
4. Suggest filtering by specific test names or models if needed

### Task 2: "Which models are slowest?"

1. Run: `snow sql -f scripts/slowest_models.sql -c default`
2. Help identify if slowness is consistent (avg) or intermittent (max)
3. Suggest investigating models > 5 minutes or 2x baseline
4. Recommend materialization changes or optimization strategies

### Task 3: "Track test reliability over time"

1. Run: `snow sql -f scripts/test_reliability_metrics.sql -c default`
2. Help identify flaky tests (failure_rate_pct between 10-90%)
3. Recommend investigating tests with 100% failure rate
4. Suggest baseline: < 5% failure rate for healthy tests

### Task 4: "Set up dbt Artifacts"

1. Walk through 3-step installation (packages.yml → dbt_project.yml → dbt deps)
2. Verify installation: `dbt run --select dbt_artifacts`
3. Test logging: `dbt run` (any command) then query `invocations` table
4. Recommend dedicated schema and archival strategy

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

| Issue                | Solution                                                                      |
| -------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| "No data in tables"  | Verify `on-run-end` hook in dbt_project.yml; run `dbt run` to trigger logging |
| "Tables not created" | Run `dbt run --select dbt_artifacts` explicitly first                         |
| "Permission denied"  | Ensure dbt user has CREATE/INSERT rights in target database/schema            |
| "Missing columns"    | Update package: `dbt deps --upgrade` to latest version                        |
| "Slow queries"       | Add date filter on `run_started_at`; consider archiving old data              |

## Monitoring Best Practices

### Test Quality Best Practices

**Establish baselines:**

- **Healthy**: Test failure rate < 5%
- **Warning**: Test failure rate 5-10%
- **Critical**: Test failure rate > 10%

**Identify flaky tests:**

- Failure rate between 10-90% (inconsistent results)
- Recommend investigation or test refactoring

**Alert on patterns:**

- New test with 100% failure rate (incorrect test logic)
- Previously stable test suddenly failing
- Test execution time 2x+ baseline

### Model Performance Best Practices

**Performance thresholds:**

- **Investigate**: Models consistently > 5 minutes
- **Critical**: Runtime increase > 2x historical average
- **Optimize**: Models in top 20 slowest

**Alert strategies:**

- High priority: Models with `status = 'error'`
- Medium priority: Runtime increase > 50% from baseline
- Low priority: Slow model trending (track over time)

### Alerting Best Practices

**High Priority (Immediate Action):**

- Test status = 'fail' or 'error'
- Model status = 'error'
- Critical model runtime > 2x baseline
- Production environment failures

**Medium Priority (Investigation Within 24h):**

- Test status = 'warn'
- Model skipped > 10% of runs
- Runtime increase > 50% from baseline
- Unusual invocation patterns

**Low Priority (Track Trends):**

- Slow model performance (not critical path)
- Test success rate slowly declining
- Incremental drift in execution duration
