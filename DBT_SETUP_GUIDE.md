This guide walks you through setting up dbt for Snowflake development on various platforms.

## üèîÔ∏è dbt Projects on Snowflake (Recommended)

**New in 2025**: Snowflake now offers native support for dbt projects directly within the Snowflake platform. This is our **recommended approach** for most teams, but we do have instructions below for local installs.

### What is dbt Projects on Snowflake?

[dbt Projects on Snowflake](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/data-engineering/dbt-projects-on-snowflake) is a native integration that allows you to create, edit, test, run, and manage dbt Core projects directly within Snowflake using:

- **Snowsight Workspaces**: Web-based IDE for dbt development
- **DBT PROJECT Objects**: Schema-level objects that contain versioned dbt projects
- **Native Execution**: Run dbt commands using Snowflake warehouses
- **Git Integration**: Connect workspaces to Git repositories for version control
- **Task Scheduling**: Use Snowflake tasks to orchestrate dbt runs

### Key Benefits

‚úÖ **No Local Setup Required**: Develop dbt projects entirely in the browser  
‚úÖ **Negligible Cost**: Leverages an existing virtual warehouse that can also execute the queries 
‚úÖ **Integrated Monitoring**: Built-in observability and logging  
‚úÖ **Version Control**: Automatic versioning of dbt project objects  
‚úÖ **Team Collaboration**: Share workspaces and manage access with RBAC  
‚úÖ **CI/CD Ready**: Integrate with Snowflake CLI for automated deployments  
‚úÖ **Package Management**: Access dbt Hub packages with proper external access configuration  

### Getting Started with dbt Projects on Snowflake

1. **Enable Personal Database** (requires ACCOUNTADMIN):
   ```sql
   -- Enable personal databases for your account
   ALTER ACCOUNT SET ENABLE_PERSONAL_DATABASE = TRUE;
   ```

2. **Set Up External Access Integration** (requires ACCOUNTADMIN):
   ```sql
   -- Create NETWORK RULE for external access integration
   CREATE OR REPLACE NETWORK RULE dbt_network_rule
     MODE = EGRESS
     TYPE = HOST_PORT
     -- Minimal URL allowlist that is required for dbt deps
     VALUE_LIST = (
       'hub.getdbt.com',
       'codeload.github.com'
       );

   -- Create EXTERNAL ACCESS INTEGRATION for dbt access to external dbt package locations
   CREATE OR REPLACE EXTERNAL ACCESS INTEGRATION dbt_ext_access
     ALLOWED_NETWORK_RULES = (dbt_network_rule)
     ENABLED = TRUE;
   ```

3. **Set Up Git Repository Integration**:
   - **Option A - Connect Existing Repository**:
     - Navigate to **Data** ‚Üí **Databases** in Snowsight
     - Create a Git repository object to connect your existing dbt project repository
     - This allows you to sync your workspace with your Git repository
   
   - **Option B - Start Fresh**:
     - Create a new Git repository for your dbt project
     - You can initialize this later when creating your workspace

4. **Create a Workspace**:
   - Navigate to **Projects** ‚Üí **Worksheets** in Snowsight
   - Click **+ Workspace** and select **dbt Projects on Snowflake**
   - Choose to create a new project or connect to an existing Git repository
   - If connecting to Git, select your repository object created in step 3

5. **Configure Your Project**:
   - Each workspace requires a `profiles.yml` file specifying target warehouse, database, schema, and role
   - The project will run under your current Snowflake account and user context
   - Example `profiles.yml`:
     ```yaml
     my_dbt_project:
       target: dev
       outputs:
         dev:
           type: snowflake
           account: ""  # Leave empty - uses current account context
           user: ""     # Leave empty - uses current user context
           warehouse: MY_WAREHOUSE
           database: MY_DATABASE
           schema: MY_SCHEMA
           role: MY_ROLE
     ```

6. **Deploy as DBT PROJECT Object**:
   - Deploy your workspace as a schema-level DBT PROJECT object
   - This enables version control, scheduling, and production execution
   - Use the **Deploy** button in your workspace or SQL commands

### Supported dbt Commands

| Command | Workspaces | EXECUTE DBT PROJECT | snow dbt execute |
|---------|------------|-------------------|------------------|
| `build` | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ |
| `compile` | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ |
| `run` | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ |
| `test` | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ |
| `seed` | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ |
| `snapshot` | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ |
| `deps` | ‚úÖ (workspace only) | ‚ùå | ‚ùå |

### Scheduling and Automation

You can [schedule dbt project execution](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/data-engineering/dbt-projects-on-snowflake-schedule-project-execution) using Snowflake tasks:

```sql
-- Create a task to run your dbt project daily
CREATE TASK my_dbt_daily_task
  WAREHOUSE = 'MY_WAREHOUSE'
  SCHEDULE = 'USING CRON 0 6 * * * UTC'  -- Daily at 6 AM UTC
AS
  EXECUTE DBT PROJECT my_dbt_project_object COMMAND 'build';

-- Start the task
ALTER TASK my_dbt_daily_task RESUME;
```

### Team Collaboration Flexibility

**Important**: Teams can use different development approaches simultaneously:

- **Developer A**: Uses dbt Projects on Snowflake workspaces
- **Developer B**: Uses dbt Cloud for development  
- **Developer C**: Uses VS Code with local dbt installation
- **All developers**: Check code into the same Git repository

This flexibility allows teams to adopt dbt Projects on Snowflake gradually while maintaining existing workflows.

### When to Use dbt Projects on Snowflake

**‚úÖ Recommended for:**
- Teams already heavily invested in Snowflake
- Organizations wanting to minimize local development setup
- Projects requiring tight integration with Snowflake features
- Teams needing centralized dbt execution and monitoring

**ü§î Consider alternatives if:**
- You need dbt Cloud's advanced features (IDE, semantic layer, etc.)
- Your team prefers local development environments
- You're using multiple data warehouses beyond Snowflake

## üíª Traditional dbt Setup (Alternative Approaches)

If you prefer traditional dbt development or need features not yet available in dbt Projects on Snowflake, the following sections cover local installation options.

## Prerequisites

This project depends on the following two data sets:

- **SNOWFLAKE_SAMPLE_DATA** that is available by default in all new Snowflake accounts
- **[Snowflake Finance & Economics](https://app.snowflake.com/marketplace/data-products/search?search=Finance%20%26%20Economics)**, formerly known as the Cybersyn Financial Economic Essentials.
  - It is available for free in the Snowflake Data Marketplace
  - If named other than "CYBERSYN_FINANCIAL_ECONOMIC_ESSENTIALS", update the database name in sources.yml

## Installing dbt using Miniforge (Recommended)

If you can install your own software, I generally recommend using [Miniforge](https://conda-forge.org/download/) to create an isolated Python environment just for dbt. Miniforge is completely open source, does not require a license like Anaconda or Miniconda, and uses the free Conda-Forge repository for packages. A dbt-conda-env.yml file has been provided so you can set up this environment and switch to it with the following commands. This is much simpler than some other flavors of Python.

```shell
conda env create -f dbt-conda-env.yml
conda activate dbt
```

If you have SSL errors, you may need to install pip_system_certs into your base environment first. The dbt-conda-env.yml file already includes this for your child environment. The `--trusted-host` parameters below will allow you to bypass firewall issues.

```shell
conda activate base
python -m pip install pip -U --trusted-host pypi.org --trusted-host pypi.python.org --trusted-host files.pythonhosted.org
python -m pip install pip_system_certs -U --trusted-host pypi.org --trusted-host pypi.python.org --trusted-host files.pythonhosted.org
```

## Installing dbt using any other flavor of Python - Windows

### Setting up Python and verifying which python you are now using:

- Install Python using your company's Self Service portal or install the [open source version of Python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- First you will want to see if you have the correct version of Python in your path using a Windows Command Prompt:
    ```shell
    where python
    python --version
    ```
- It should return a path like `C:\Program Files\Python311`. You can use Python 3.9 and higher. If you can't run `python --version` it is likely that you do not have the right version of python in your PATH.

### How to change your PATH

If this is not the correct version of Python or the wrong location, you can update your PATH on Windows 10 & 11 using the following:
1. Open Start Search, type "env", and select "Edit the system environment variables".
2. Click the "Environment Variables‚Ä¶" button.
3. In the "User Variables" section, locate "Path", and click edit.
4. In the "Edit environment variable" UI, click "New" to add the new path to your preferred version of Python.
5. Use the "Move Up" button to make your new path the first entry
6. Close and reopen any command prompts or VS Code to use the new PATH
7. Use the `where python` and `python --version` commands again to verify that you are now using the correct version.

### Update pip and install dbt

- Next make sure pip is up to date and that pip_system_certs is also installed. The `--trusted-host` parameters below will help you avoid firewall issues.
    ```shell
    python -m pip install pip -U --trusted-host pypi.org --trusted-host pypi.python.org --trusted-host files.pythonhosted.org
    python -m pip install pip_system_certs -U --trusted-host pypi.org --trusted-host pypi.python.org --trusted-host files.pythonhosted.org
    ```
- Next install virtualenv and create a new virtual environment called `dbt`
    ```shell
    python -m pip install --user virtualenv
    python -m venv dbt
    ```
- Now you can activate your virtual environment, verify that the location of python has changed, and install dbt
    ```shell
    .\dbt\Scripts\activate
    where python
    python -m pip install -U dbt-core dbt-snowflake
    dbt --version
    ```

## Installing dbt using any other flavor of Python - Unix/macOS

- Install Python using your company's Self Service portal or install the [open source version of Python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- First you will want to see if you have the correct version of Python in your path using a shell:
    ```shell
    which python
    python --version
    ```
- You can use Python 3.8 and higher. If you can't run `python --version` it is likely that you do not have the right version of python in your PATH.

### How to change your PATH

This command can be used to append your folder before the existing PATH. You may need to add this to your .bash_profile or other shell configuration file to make the change permanent.

```shell
export PATH=/my/path/to/python/:$PATH
```

### Update pip and install dbt

- Next make sure pip is up to date and that pip_system_certs is also installed. The `--trusted-host` parameters below will help you avoid firewall issues.
    ```shell
    python -m pip install pip -U --trusted-host pypi.org --trusted-host pypi.python.org --trusted-host files.pythonhosted.org
    python -m pip install pip_system_certs -U --trusted-host pypi.org --trusted-host pypi.python.org --trusted-host files.pythonhosted.org
    ```
- Next install virtualenv and create a new virtual environment called `dbt`
    ```shell
    python -m pip install --user virtualenv
    python -m venv dbt
    ```
- Now you can activate your virtual environment, verify that the location of python has changed, and install dbt. We install/update pip and pip_system_certs this time in the virtual env.
    ```shell
    source dbt/bin/activate
    which python
    python -m pip install pip -U --trusted-host pypi.org --trusted-host pypi.python.org --trusted-host files.pythonhosted.org
    python -m pip install pip_system_certs -U --trusted-host pypi.org --trusted-host pypi.python.org --trusted-host files.pythonhosted.org
    python -m pip install -U dbt-core dbt-snowflake
    dbt --version
    ```

## Creating a simple dbt sample project to test your connection to Snowflake

The dbt init command can step you through creating a `~/.dbt/profiles.yml` file and starter project structure.

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important Notes:**
- Running this project will create a table and a view in the schema you specify.
- The sample project is designed to have a test fail when you first run `dbt build`. If you open the first model under /models/ you will see that it has a where clause you can uncomment to make the test pass.

```shell
dbt init
dbt compile
dbt build
```

## Setting Up Your Editor

Most dbt users edit their dbt scripts with Microsoft's free editor, VSCode:

### VSCode Setup
- [Download VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download)
- From the Extensions screen (icon looks like Tetris) you should install two extensions:
  - **python**
  - **["Snowflake"](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/vscode-ext)**
- In the Explorer, right click in the background and "Add folder to workspace" to add where your dbt project will be located.
- On Windows, you will want to change the default terminal to "Command Prompt". Under *File* -> *Preferences* -> *Settings*, search for "windows terminal" and scroll down to where it says the default is "null" and change that to "Command Prompt".
- You will want to set the default interpreter to your new "dbt" environment using [these instructions from Microsoft](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/python-tutorial#_select-a-python-interpreter).

## Setting Up Your Snowflake Account for this sample project

- Create a target schema in Snowflake that you want to deploy your dbt demo into
- Add the Knoema Economy Data Atlas and Snowflake Sample Data to your account if necessary

## Update Configuration For Your Account and Test Execution

- Update your `~/.dbt/profiles.yml` file with your credentials and target DB/schema. There is a sample profiles.yml file you can copy to your ~/.dbt/ folder and update if you don't already have one.
- From the root folder, run `dbt deps` to download modules from the dbt hub
- Run `dbt build --full-refresh` and troubleshoot any errors such as missing objects or permission issues

## Cheatsheet of most common dbt commands

### Essential Commands
- `dbt deps` - download 3rd party packages (necessary for this project before build)
- `dbt build` - both compile and then run all models & associated tests
- `dbt build --full-refresh` - have incremental models run as a full reload

### Selection Commands
- `dbt build --select modelname` - will only compile/run modelname
- `dbt build --select +modelname` - will compile/run modelname and all parents
- `dbt build --select modelname+` - will compile/run modelname and all children
- `dbt build --select +modelname+` - will compile/run modelname, and all parents and children
- `dbt build --select @modelname` - will compile/run modelname, all parents, all children, AND all parents of all children
- `dbt build --exclude modelname` - will compile/run all models except modelname

### Other Useful Commands
- `dbt compile` - compile all models but do not execute them
- `dbt run` - run all models & tests
- `dbt seed` - create or refresh small tables from .csv seed files
- `dbt clean` - clear your logs and compiled scripts (can fix issues)
- `dbt docs generate` - refresh the documentation for your project
- `dbt docs generate --static` - Generate as a single static_index.html file that you can host on a server or open in your browser
- `dbt docs serve` - open this documentation in your browser

Additional commands and details are available in [dbt's documentation](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/dbt-commands)

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
- **SSL/Firewall Issues**: Use the `--trusted-host` parameters shown in the installation commands
- **Python Path Issues**: Verify you're using the correct Python version with `which python` or `where python`
- **Virtual Environment Issues**: Make sure you've activated your virtual environment before installing dbt
- **Connection Issues**: Verify your `profiles.yml` file has the correct Snowflake credentials
